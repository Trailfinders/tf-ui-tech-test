## 👋 Welcome

Thanks for taking the time to complete this test. We want to see how you think as a designer — not just what you can make look polished. There's no single right answer. We're looking for clear thinking, considered decisions, and a design you can talk us through.

Read this brief fully before opening Figma.

## 🗺️ The Brief

**Redesign the Private Touring landing page for Trailfinders.**

Trailfinders is the UK's most trusted travel brand — established in 1970, with a specialist Private Touring team and over 750 expert consultants. Their private tours offer travellers their own dedicated guide and driver, an entirely bespoke itinerary, and the freedom to explore at their own pace. No groups, no fixed schedules — just you, a knowledgeable local guide, and the destination.

The page you're redesigning is **trailfinders.com/holiday-styles/private-touring** — the landing page that introduces Private Touring as a holiday style and encourages visitors to explore destinations or get in touch with the specialist team.

The current page exists, but we'd like to see your fresh take on it. Think about what a visitor to this page actually needs to understand, feel, and do — and design accordingly.

## 🧍 The User

The typical visitor to this page is a UK-based traveller, likely 40+, with travel experience and a higher disposable income. They may be comparing holiday styles or arriving after searching "private touring holidays." They know roughly what they want — a tailored, personal experience — but they need to be convinced that Trailfinders is the right company to book it with, and inspired to take the next step.

## ✏️ What to Design

**One page — your choice of desktop (1440px) or mobile (390px).** You are redesigning the Private Touring *landing page* — not a specific tour detail page. Think of it like a category or hub page: it explains what private touring is, why Trailfinders does it well, and directs visitors to the right next step.

Pick whichever format you feel strongest in. If you choose mobile, think carefully about how sections stack, how CTAs behave on a small screen, and how imagery works in a narrower layout. If you choose desktop, think about use of whitespace, grid, and visual hierarchy across a wide canvas. Either is valid — just tell us your choice and why in `NOTES.md`.

Your page must include all five of the following sections. The order and visual treatment are entirely your decision.

---

### 1. Hero
The first thing a visitor sees. It should immediately communicate what private touring is and why it's special.

Include: a headline, a short supporting line, and a clear primary CTA (e.g. "Explore Private Tours" or "Speak to Our Team").

> Think about: what feeling do you want to create in the first three seconds?

---

### 2. What Is Private Touring?
A brief explanation of the holiday style — what makes it different from a group tour or independent travel.

Key points to convey: your own private guide and driver, completely bespoke itinerary, travel entirely at your own pace, suitable for couples, families, and solo travellers.

> This section should be scannable — not a wall of text.

---

### 3. Why Book With Trailfinders?
Trailfinders has a dedicated specialist Private Touring team, over 54 years of experience, and is the UK & Ireland's most trusted travel brand. Their consultants average 8+ years' experience and take 3,000+ fact-finding trips abroad each year.

Include 3–4 trust or value points that would convince someone to book through Trailfinders rather than going elsewhere.

> Think about: what reassures a high-spend customer that they're in safe hands?

---

### 4. Destinations
Showcase the breadth of regions available for private touring. Trailfinders offers private tours across Europe, East Africa, South & Central America, Japan, China & South Korea, and many more.

This could be a grid of destination cards, a map, a carousel — whatever works best in your layout.

> You don't need to design all destinations — pick 4–6 to represent the range.

---

### 5. Enquire / Get in Touch
A clear call to action to connect with the Private Touring specialist team. Trailfinders' model is consultant-led — visitors don't book online, they enquire and are called back.

Include at minimum: a prompt to get in touch, a reference to the specialist team, and a primary action button (e.g. "Submit an Enquiry" or "Request a Callback").

## 🎯 Design Requirements

- **Desktop (1440px) or mobile (390px)** — pick one and commit to it. Tell us why you chose it.
- **Cohesive page** — all sections should feel like one brand, not five separate blocks.
- **Max 2 typefaces** — prioritise legibility and hierarchy over variety.
- **Considered colour palette** — reflect a trusted, premium British travel brand. Explain your choices in `NOTES.md`. The existing Trailfinders brand uses deep navy and red — you can stay close to this or propose a refined direction. Either is valid, but explain why.
- **Real-feeling content** — write realistic placeholder copy, use Unsplash or similar for imagery. Avoid Lorem ipsum.

**Paste your Figma link into `NOTES.md`** — set sharing to "Anyone with the link can view".

## 📝 NOTES.md — Tell Us Your Thinking

Fill in the `NOTES.md` file. Keep it short — bullet points are fine. Cover:

1. **What were the key design decisions you made?** (layout, colour, type, section order — and why)
2. **Who were you designing for?** What did you assume about the user coming to this page?
3. **What would you improve or add with more time?**

This is just as important as the design itself.

---

## 💡 A Few Tips

- **Visit the existing page first** — trailfinders.com/holiday-styles/private-touring. Understanding what currently exists will help you make sharper decisions about what to change and what to keep.
- **Content before style** — decide what each section needs to say before you think about how it looks.
- **Scannable over exhaustive** — this is a landing page, not a brochure. People skim. Design for that.
- **Be bold** — a confident, justified design direction is far more interesting to review than a safe, generic one.

Good luck — we're looking forward to seeing what you come up with! 🎉
