## The Page at a Glance

You're redesigning the **Private Touring landing page** for **Trailfinders** — trailfinders.com/holiday-styles/private-touring.

This is a **category hub page**, not a specific tour page. It explains the holiday style, builds trust in Trailfinders as the right company to book with, showcases destinations, and drives visitors to enquire with the specialist team.

## Page Sections Checklist

All five sections are required. Order and visual treatment are your decision.

| # | Section | Core job |
|---|---------|----------|
| 1 | **Hero** | Headline + tagline + primary CTA |
| 2 | **What Is Private Touring?** | Explain the holiday style — own guide, own driver, bespoke itinerary, your pace |
| 3 | **Why Book With Trailfinders?** | 3–4 trust/value points — 54 years' experience, specialist team, most trusted travel brand |
| 4 | **Destinations** | 4–6 regions available (Europe, East Africa, Japan, South America, etc.) |
| 5 | **Enquire / Get in Touch** | Drive visitors to contact the specialist Private Touring team |

## Canvas Specs

Choose **one** format and design for it fully.

| Format | Width | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Desktop** | 1440px | Think whitespace, grid, wide imagery |
| **Mobile** | 390px | Think stacking, thumb-friendly CTAs, scroll |

Tell us which you chose and why in `NOTES.md`.

## Brand Context

Trailfinders is a trusted, expert British travel brand — not flashy, not ultra-luxury, but premium, knowledgeable, and reliable. The existing brand uses deep navy and red. You can work within this palette or propose a refined direction — but your choice must feel right for a high-trust travel brand with a UK audience aged 40+. Explain it in your notes.

## What We're Looking For

| | |
|---|---|
| **Clarity** | Does each section have a clear, single purpose? |
| **Hierarchy** | Is the most important content the most visible? |
| **Brand fit** | Does it feel like a trusted, established British travel brand? |
| **Scannability** | Can a visitor grasp the page in 30 seconds? |
| **Rationale** | Can you explain every significant design decision? |

---

## Colour & Type

- Max **2 typefaces**
- Palette should feel right for a **premium, trusted British travel brand**

---

## Content Notes

- Write **realistic placeholder copy** — avoid Lorem ipsum
- Use **Unsplash** (unsplash.com) for destination imagery
- Destination cards can use: Europe, East Africa, South America, Japan & Far East, North America, The Middle East — pick 4–6
- Trailfinders' key trust facts: Founded 1970 · UK & Ireland's Most Trusted Travel Brand · 750+ consultants · 8+ years avg. experience · 3,000+ staff fact-finding trips per year
